# Health Insurance Cost Predictor

This project is a machine learning-based health insurance cost predictor. It predicts the cost of health insurance based on various features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and more. The model has been trained on a dataset that contains these attributes and aims to provide accurate cost predictions.

## Features:
- Predicts health insurance costs using machine learning algorithms.
- Allows users to input personal data such as age, gender, BMI, and smoking status.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface through a **Streamlit app** for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Setup and Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app with `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Input the required data to get predictions for health insurance costs.

## Goal:
The project aims to help individuals estimate their health insurance premiums based on personal data, offering a useful tool for better financial planning.

Feel free to explore the app and modify it as needed for your own use cases!
